# Progression:
Week 1:
- Initial try with pygame, and random generation of houses.

Week 2:
- Now using matplotlib package for visualization.
- Layed the basis functions like; house generation, map generation,
random number generation.
- Transformation to python 3.
- Call the program from one function with variant(20/40/60) as input.


# Planning:
Week 2:
- Presentation preparation.
- Processing feedback into code (resolution x10).
- Random water parts generated into code.

Week 3:
- Finding literature for remaining algorithms.
- Score function.
- First algorithm: all at random.

Week 4:
- Saving results from algorithms (scores).
- Second algorithm.
- Experiment: comparing first with second algorithm.
- Presentation preparation.
- Processing feedback from presentation.

Week 5:
- Third algorithm.
- Experiment: comparing algorithms.
